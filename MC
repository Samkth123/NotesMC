1. Interviewer presents background info on case, what the problem is and what the objectives are (Understanding what the Case background information is)
2. You synthesize major points of the case background information and verify objectives (iii. Verify objectives)
3. You request time to structure thoughts into a framework (IV. Develop a structured framework)
4. Handle silence 2-3 minutes of writing framework
5. You preset framework to interviewer (VI. presenting frameowork)
6. You + interviewer: Either interviewer will review the framework and suggest starting area to start the case OR you will be expected to suggest an area to start the case (VII Starting the case)
7. You + interviewer: Solving quantitative problem (VIII Solving Quantitative Problems)
8. You + interviewer: Solving qualitativequestions on business judgement/intuition(XI: Answering qualititative business questions)
9. You + interviewer: summary or recommendation (X. Delivering a Conclusion)

The case interview should not sound like a Q&A session. Even for the sections above that are not marked “You + Interviewer”, you should still be engaged with the interviewer, asking questions, aligning on the path forward, and asking for input.


### Profitability

Profitability is a measurement of how well a company is doing for the business owner and stockholders. It’s especially important for public companies. It’s measured by the return on investment, or ROI. This helps companies determine whether they’re making enough money. Profitability describes how much the company makes compared to its investment in assets like equipment and technology. It measures how efficient those investments are.

Profitability matters for businesses that use debt or capital investments to grow.

Profitability can be measured by return on assets (ROA) or profit margin ratio. This is the ratio of profit over total costs like inventory, equipment, and supply. The ROA helps companies determine whether or not their investments are creating acceptable returns.

The difference between profitability and profit is that profitability measures the long-term health of a company. Profit is more short-term. This definition can also say that profit focuses on bottom-line income while profitability measures the return on investment.

: Let’s say that the CEO walks in and wants an update and preliminary recommendation on what you have been working on so far. What do you say?


### II. Understanding the Case Background Information


The main objectives for you are to: 
1. Understand the situation of the case 
2. Determine what the goals or objectives of the case are 
3. Ask clarifying questions


You are  leaving an impression on the interviewer based on the questions you ask. Therefore, ensure that you are: 
1. NOT asking irrelevant questions about the case 
2. NOT asking the interviewer to repeat a tremendous amount of information 
3. NOT interrupting the interviewer too much


**The first objective**, **understanding the situation**, requires that you have an understanding of the various pieces of information that the interviewer disclose to you. Examples of information that are likely important include: 
- What is the name of the company/client that we are trying to help? 
- What do they do or make? 
- How are they doing in the market? 
- What major actions has the company/client done recently? 
- How is the market that they are in doing? 
- What is the competitive landscape like? 
- What have competitors been doing?

**The second objective, determining the goals of the case**, dictates what you will be doing for the rest of the case interview. Cases may have a single objective or multiple ones. Examples of common objectives are: 
- Determine whether or not the company/client should enter a new market 
- Determine whether or not the company/client should acquire another company 
- Determine why the company/client is losing revenue 
- Determine why the company/client has been experiencing increasing costs 
- Determine why the profitability of the company/client has been decreasing 
- Determine what to do about a new competitor entering the market


**The third objective requires that you ask clarifying questions when needed**. There may be a particular term that you are not familiar with, or you may need the interviewer to repeat a piece of information.


During this part of the case interview, you **should be taking notes** on what the interviewer is telling you.

Have landscape mode A4 paper. 2/3 for framework and 1/3 most left side for notes. Any math calculations should be done on seperate piece of paper.

As the case goes on, if there are any key takeaways or important pieces of information that you discover, make a note of it in your notes column. Doing this will make the conclusion part of the case interview much easier for you, as you have recorded all of the key pieces of information in one place.

You are most likely not going to be able to write down every single thing that your interviewer says. Therefore, it is important that you are taking notes in a bullet point format. You should not be taking notes in complete sentences. Feel free to use any shorthand notation, as long as you can easily recall what you mean later on in the case. An example of shorthand could be writing down “R↓, C↑” instead of “revenue has decreased and costs have increased.”



### III. Verifying Objectives

You’ve taken some great notes, and if you had any clarifying questions, you have asked them and had them answered. For this next part of the case interview, your objectives are to: 
1. **Synthesize and present the key pieces of information** in a clear, concise, and confident way 
2. **Verify what the goals or objectives** of the case are 

This is the part of the case interview where your evaluation begins. In this part, the interviewer is looking for your:
- Ability to synthesize information and identify what is important 
- Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident way



For the **first objective**, synthesizing key pieces of information, you can differentiate yourself from other candidates if your **recap of the information is short and sweet**.


The **most common mistake** I see is people reciting back all of the information they have heard to the interviewer. The interviewer does not want to listen to an exact playback of what they have just said to the candidate. They are testing whether the interviewee can parse out the most important pieces of information from the rest of the minor details.

Another **common mistake** I see is interviewees inserting their own assumptions or conclusions during the recap. The recap should be strictly factual. You should not be inserting information that the interviewer has not given you. You can state your assumptions or conclusions in later parts of the case

##### Example:
Let’s say that your interviewer gives you the following information:

Our client makes several varieties of sweet jams, such as strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry, in the US. During the past winter, a strong blizzard has hit one of the groves where the berries grow. As a result, our client has lost roughly a quarter of their berries. Because of this, they are considering planting peanuts in Mexico so that they can produce peanut butter in addition to sweet jams. This way, if a strong blizzard hits the US again, our client will still have peanuts to produce peanut butter. Should they enter the peanut butter market?

**A bad recap:**
“Our client makes several varieties of sweet jams, such as strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry. During the past winter, a strong blizzard hit one of the groves where the berries grow. Our client lost roughly a quarter of their berries that they use for jams. Since this probably caused a decrease in profits, they are also considering planting peanuts in a different region to produce peanut butter. The objective is to determine whether or not they should enter the peanut butter market to increase profits.”

This recap is bad for a variety of reasons. First, it is not concise. It is almost as long as the original statement given by the interviewer. Second, even though the recap is long, it leaves out important pieces of information (e.g. the client is a US company looking to expand internationally into Mexico). Third, the recap introduces some assumptions or conclusions that the interviewer never mentioned (e.g. decline in profits as a result of the blizzard).

**A good recap:**
“Our client produces jams in the US. During the past winter, they have lost a quarter of their berries due to a blizzard. Because of this, they are considering planting peanuts in Mexico and entering the peanut butter market. The objective is to determine whether or not they should enter the peanut butter market.”

For the **second objective**, verifying the goals of the case, it is important to make sure that you and the interviewer are aligned on what the goals of the case are. Even the best interview candidates in the world will still verify the objectives with the interviewer because they know how important it is. This part is easy but important because it sets the tone for the rest of the interview and if it goes good you gain momentum.


### IV. Developing a Structured Framework

The most generic framework that candidates commonly use is a four bucket framework consisting of: customer, competition, product, and company. While this framework is useful, we can do better than that. The framework listed above will not help differentiate yourself from the other candidates. It is extremely generic and over used

#### Criteria for developing an exceptional framework

1. All buckets must be relevant to the objective of the case 
2. Buckets should not have any overlap with each another 
3. There should be three to four buckets (however, some cases may naturally have only two) 
4. The framework is not a generic framework (like the one listed above) 
5. Under each bucket, there are two to three sub-bullets, which add detail and specifics about what each bucket means 
6. The sub-bullets are all relevant to the objective of the case 
7. The sub-bullets do not have any overlap with one another


For the sixth and seventh objectives, just as your buckets had to be relevant to the objective of the case and not overlap with one another, so too do all of your sub-bullets under each bucket.



#### Strategy to tackling frameworks

There are definitely things that you must memorize and be able to recall from the top of your head, but you also get to do novel, creative thinking throughout the process.

Memorize a list of eight different buckets. When you encounter a case:

**Step One** : Mentally run through the list of eight buckets and select the three to four that are the most relevant.

**Step Two**: Once you select the buckets, brainstorm two to three sub-bullets for each of the buckets.

That’s it. You only need to memorize eight things.


**For step one**, you should have these eight buckets fully memorized by heart. You should be able to wake up in the middle of the night and immediately recall the eight buckets within ten seconds. This part is fairly easy.

**For step two**, this is where you will need to do most of your thinking and spend the majority of your time mastering the skill. The two to three sub-bullets should be tailored to the exact case that you are trying to solve for. They should not be completely memorized. The more cases you do the easier this will be

What are the **eight buckets that you need to memorize**? They are as follows: 
1. Market attractiveness
2. Competitive landscape 
3. Company attractiveness OR company capabilities 
4. Customer segmentation and needs 
5. Financial considerations 
6. Risks and mitigations
7. Synergies
8. Create your own bucket


First of all, the names of the buckets are longer than one word. Instead of using the bucket “market”, we use “market attractiveness”. Instead of “competition”, we use “competitive landscape". Although these are common buckets used in frameworks, we create the illusion of a more unique framework by adding a slightly longer description to the bucket name.

Second, do not be tied to the exact wording of the bucket names. For example, look at the third bullet above. If in a case you are looking into acquiring another company, “company attractiveness” would be the right bucket name to use. If in another case, you are looking into entering a market, “company capabilities” would be the right bucket name to use. You may slightly customize the naming of the buckets for each case. If you are analyzing the cellphone market, you could call the bucket “cellphone market attractiveness” instead of “market attractiveness.” If you are analyzing a company named Diamond Co., you can call the bucket “Diamond Co. capabilities” instead of “company capabilities.” What is important is that you are memorizing the concept of each bucket. Do not be so tied down to memorizing the exact phrases or words as long as you remember the concept or theme behind each bucket.

#### Understanding the eight buckets

1. **Market attractiveness**: Anything about the market goes into this bucket. 
	1. What is the market size? 
	2. What is the market growth rate? 
	3. What are average profit margins in the market? 
	4. What are the major trends/changes going on in the market? 
	5. Are there new technologies in the market? 
	6. Are there new regulations? 
	7. Is the market developing or mature? 
	8. Is the market converging with another market?
2. **Competitive landscape**: Anything about competitors goes into this bucket. 
	1. Who are the competitors in the market? 
	2. How much market share does each player have? 
	3. What products do competitors sell? 
	4. What capabilities do competitors have? 
	5. What do some competitors do to differentiate themselves from the other players in the market? 
	6. What are the barriers to entry?
3. **Company attractiveness/company capabilities**: Anything about the company you are working with or the company that you are looking to analyze or acquire goes into this bucket. 
	1. What line of products does the company offer? 
	2. What ways do the products differentiate themselves from other products? 
	3. How much market share does the company have? 
	4. How profitable is the company? 
	5. What distribution channels does the company have? 
	6. What partnerships does the company have? 
	7. How much buying power does the company have? 
	8. What is the go-to-market strategy of the company? 
	9. In what geographic regions is the company based in? 
	10. Is the company growing or declining?
4. **Customer segmentation and needs**: Anything about customers in the target market goes into this bucket. 
	1. What are the different customer segments? 
	2. What are the characteristics of each customer segment? 
	3. What are the needs/preferences of each customer segment? 
	4. How are customers changing in each customer segment? 
	5. How profitable is each customer segment?

5. **Financial considerations**: Anything regarding revenue, costs, and profit goes into this bucket. 
	1. Is the implication of this business decision profitable? 
	2. What are the different revenue elements? 
	3. What are the different cost elements? 
	4. How can we increase revenues? 
	5. How can we decrease costs? 
	6. What is the pricing strategy? 
	7. How long will it take to breakeven? 
	8. What is the cost of acquisition? 
	9. What is the financial exit-strategy of this business decision?
6. **Synergies**: Anything about synergies between two companies, or two products goes into this bucket. 
	1. What are the possible revenue synergies? 
	2. What are the possible cost synergies? 
	3. Are synergies realizable? 
	4. How long will realizing these synergies take?

7. **Risks and mitigations**: This is a versatile bucket that you can use in frameworks where you need one more bucket but can’t think of one. 
	1. What are the risks of this business decision? 
	2. What is the likely impact of such risks? 
	3. Can these risks be mitigated?

8. **Create your own bucket**: This eighth bucket gives you the creativity and flexibility to create your own bucket. Sometimes during a case, there will be a bucket that comes to mind that is highly relevant to the case, but may not be explicitly captured by the seven buckets above. Feel free to create your own bucket for cases as long as the bucket follows the criteria of an exceptional framework that was outlined earlier in this chapter.




#### Examples of this strategy put to use

	- What are the possible exit strategies for acquiring Company B?



### V. Handling the Moment of Silence


The objectives of this part of the case are: 
1. Do not take more than two to three minutes of complete silence 
2. Keep track of how much time has gone by 
3. If you are approaching two to three minutes and need more time, connect with the interviewer to let them know you need another minute

There is nothing that the interviewer is explicitly evaluating you on in this part of the case since there will be mainly silence. However, the interviewer is still observing your demeanor and behavior. To ensure that the interviewer does not form a negative impression of you, make sure you are:
- NOT spending more than two to three minutes in complete silence 
- NOT visibly looking stressed or frantic

###### Important note
This is the **only part** of the case interview when it is **okay for there to be complete silence** between you and the interviewer. For **all other parts of the case**, the interview should be collaborative and **you and the interviewer should be talking back and forth in discussion**.

For the second objective, how can you tell how much time has gone by? The first method is practice

For the third objective, if you feel that you are going over three minutes and notice the interviewer getting restless and impatient, you can do this one trick. Simply break the silence by saying something like “I am just wrapping up now; I will need another 30 seconds” or “Thanks for your patience; I just need another minute or so.” You can also make yourself sound confident as you are saying these things since it shows you are proactively monitoring your progress and the time.



### VI. Presenting your Framework

Structuring your framework is the hard part; presenting it is the easy part. For this part of the case interview, make sure that you: 
1. Turn the paper around to face the interviewer so that they can read your framework 
2. Walk your interviewer through your framework at a high-level 
3. Check in with the interviewer so that they are aligned with your framework

During this part, the interviewer is looking for: 
- A structured, relevant, and unique framework (see IV. Developing a Structured Framework) 
- The ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident way

For the **first objective**, I recommend that you physically turn your paper around so that the interviewer is looking at your framework. This will make it easier for your interviewer to understand how you are thinking about the problem because they will be both reading it and hearing it. However, this is not always possible, depending on how the seating arrangement is set up.

For the **second objective**, walking your interviewer through your framework, state how many areas you’d like to look into and then list what the names of your buckets are. Then for each bucket, spend 30 seconds discussing the most important sub-bullets of each.

For the third objective, it is important to check in with the interviewer to see if they are aligned with the framework and your approach to the problem. Say something like “Does this sound good?” or “Does that make sense?” As a reminder, you want to touch base with the interviewer throughout the entire case interview process so that you are on the right track.

Below is an **example** of how you should sound when you are presenting your framework. For this example, let’s say that you are given a case on whether or not a US strawberry jam producer should enter the peanut butter market. You should present your framework in the following way:

“To determine whether or not it is a good idea to enter the peanut butter market, there are four areas I’d like to look into. 

First, I’d like to look at the market attractiveness of the peanut butter market. I’d like to look into what the market size is, what the market growth rate is, and what the average margins are in the peanut butter market. Essentially, I want to know: is this market attractive enough for us to enter? 

Second, I’d like to look at the competitive landscape. How many competitors are in the market? How much share do they have? I want to figure out if the market is concentrated or fragmented, and what the barriers to entry are. By looking at this category, we can better understand how difficult it would be to enter. 

Third, I’d like to look at our own company capabilities. Do we have the ability to create a great peanut butter product? Do we have any expertise in the area and know how to grow peanuts? Do we know what the recipe for peanut butter should be? Can we leverage our existing jam production equipment? Or do we need to purchase new equipment entirely? Can we leverage our existing customer and distribution channels to sell peanut butter successfully? 

For the fourth and final area, I’d like to look into the financial considerations of entering the market. Will we be profitable by selling peanut butter? How long will it take for us to break even from the initial investment we put in? What is management’s financial goals for entering the peanut butter market, and can these goals be achieved? To do this, we can project what revenues will be, and estimate what costs will be to figure out what the profitability would look like. Does this sound good?


When you finish presenting your framework, the interviewer should know exactly what the different buckets or areas that you want to look into are. After this, you and the interviewer will begin solving the case together.



### VII. Starting the Case

Once you are finished presenting your framework, this is when solving the case actually starts. All case interviews can be classified into one of two types: 
1. Cases that the interviewer leads 
2. Cases that you lead

If the case is led by you, then there are a few things that the interviewer is looking for during this part: 
- The ability to identify a high priority area to start the case 
- The ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident way

It does not matter which type of case interview you are given, the approach and methodology is exactly the same


Remember that you are **collaborating with the interviewer**. The case interview should be a discussion with both parties talking, no matter if the interviewer is leading the case or if you are leading the case. The main difference with the latter is that once you’ve presented your framework, your interviewer will ask where you want to start.

When asked this, state in which area of your framework you’d like to start and why. There is no wrong answer here as there is no way for you to know which areas will have the key pieces of information for solving the case. As long as you state where you’d like to start and the reasoning behind it makes sense, you will be fine. If you pick an area that the interviewer does not want to go down, they will suggest an alternative area.


The most important part of solving a case that you are leading is to check in frequently with the interviewer to make sure you are going down the correct path.

Example: After you present your framework, the interviewer might say something like this: “That framework sounds great. Where should we start?" You could say something like: 
“I think we should start off by looking at the competitive landscape. I want to figure out how concentrated or fragmented the market is in order to determine how difficult it would be to enter. We could also look into what the barriers to entry are, and if they can be met. Does that sound good?”


### VIII. Solving Quantitative Problems

The majority of the quantitative work in a case interview will come in either the form of market sizing or breakeven analysis.



This is what the interviewer is looking for: 
- General problem solving capabilities 
- Ability to provide structure to quantitative problems 
- Comfort in working with numbers; the ability to easily execute basic mathematical computations (e.g. don’t make a lot of math mistakes) 
- Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident way



#### Market sizing

Unless something else is specified, market size has the units of dollars ($), or whatever other currency is being used, spent in one year.

Examples of market sizing: (note that the units for these should be in dollars spent in one year): - - 

- What is the size of the contact lens market? 
- How much money is spent on computers every year? 
- What is the market size of wine?


Some other examples: (note that these units are not dollars spent in one year): 
- How many cars are sold in the US every year? 
- How many gallons of gas do Americans use every year? 
- How many minutes do Americans spend talking on their phones every year?

These market sizing questions might seem tough to answer immediately, but with enough practice, market sizing becomes straight forward and repetitive.


At a high level, there are **two different methods to tackle market sizing**. You can either take a **top-down** approach or a **bottoms-up** approach. A top-down approach is when you start with a very large number, and then refine/filter/drill-down until you get to the answer. A bottoms-up approach is when you start with a small number, and then build/multiply it up until you get to the answer

##### Example Market sizing:
Let’s say that we are asked to determine the market size of ice cream in the US

For a top-down approach, start with the number of people in the US. Then, estimate what percentage of the US population eats ice cream. Next, figure out how many pints of ice cream the average ice cream consumer would eat in a week. From that, extrapolate how many pints of ice cream are consumed in a year. Finally, estimate the average price per pint of ice cream, and multiply everything together to get the market size.

For a bottoms-up approach, start with a single ice cream store. Then, estimate how many people visit the store a day and how many pints of ice cream a person would purchase on average. Next, calculate how much money the ice cream store makes in one day, and extrapolate that to a year. Finally, estimate how many ice cream stores are in a city or town and then figure out how many cities or towns are in the US. Multiplying all of these things together gives you the market size of ice cream.

Almost all market sizing questions I’ve received can be solved with a top-down approach.

##### Process of solving market sizing question

Now that we have the general approach out of the way, let’s discuss the process of solving a market sizing question.

One mistake that interviewers commonly make is jumping right into the math and calculations without taking much time to think about their holistic approach. If you are an expert market sizer, this is fine to do, but most of us need some time to process the question and come up with a structure for what approach we want to use.

Therefore, the first step in solving a market sizing problem is to ask the interviewer for some time to structure an approach. In almost all case interviews, the interviewer will give you the time to structure and frame your approach.

When developing your structure, avoid using numbers and avoid doing any calculations at all. Remember, you are developing the approach, or steps, that you are going to take to calculate the market size. We are not making up any numbers or doing any math calculations yet.

###### example contact lens market in US size
Let’s take the example of “What is the size of the contact lens market in the US?” Using a top-down method, your approach should be something like this written on your piece of paper:

The number of people in the US 
- Segmenting the number of people in the US by age 
- Estimating the percentage of each age group that has vision problems
 - Estimating the percentage of people with vision problems in each age group that wear contact lens (instead of glasses or laser eye surgery) 
 - Estimating the number of pairs of contact lenses one person wears a year 
 - Estimating the cost of a single pair of contact lenses 
 - Multiplying across all of these will give you the market size of contact lenses in the US


You would then share this approach with your interviewer and get their approval or input before beginning to do any mathematical calculations. You could say something like the following:

“In order to size the contact lens market in the US, I will first start with the US population. I will then segment the US population by different age groups because different age groups have different percentages of people that have vision problems.

Within each age group, I would estimate the percentage of people that have vision problems. Next, I would estimate what percentage of those folks wear contact lenses.

After that, I would estimate how many pairs of contact lenses the average person wears in a year. Then, I will estimate the price per pair of contact lens. 

Finally, I can multiply all of these things together to get the market size of contact lenses in the US.”

Again, notice that there are no numbers or math calculations done when structuring the approach.

**Important**
When you are doing the math and performing the calculations, there should not be silence between you and the interviewer. You should be “**doing math out loud**” and walking the interviewer through the calculations and assumptions. Also, you should try to justify the numbers that you make up for your assumptions. These numbers can be based on something that you read, your experience in life, or any other methodology that you’ve used to come up with the numbers.

Let’s **continue our example** of solving for the contact lens market size in the US. You should say something like this as you are calculating the market size:

“First, starting with the US population, let’s assume that there are roughly 320M people in the US. To segment by age, I’m going to assume four age groups of (0-20), (20-40), (40-60), and (60-80). This means that there are 80M people in each of the four different age groups.

I’ll assume that 20% of the people in the first age group have vision problems. I chose only 20% because generally, I think that your vision is good while you are young, but will get worse with age. This means 16M (80M * 20%) people have vision problems in this age group.

I’ll assume that 30% of people in the second age group have vision problems. As people get older, there is a greater likelihood that they will have vision problems due to aging. Therefore, 24M (80M * 30%) people have vision problems in this group.

I’ll assume that 50% of people in the third and fourth groups have vision problems. Again, the rationale behind this is that vision tends to get worse with age. Therefore, 80M (160M * 50%) people have vision problems across these two age groups.

Adding up the four groups, we get a total of 120M people with vision problems (16M + 24M + 80M). Based on thinking about who among my friends and family wear contact lenses instead of glasses, let’s assume roughly a third wear contact lenses. That means 40M people wear contact lenses (120M * 1/3).

Next, let’s assume contact lenses are disposable, and 2 pairs are needed each month. This is based on the disposable contact lenses that I use. This means that one person would need 24 pairs a year (2 pairs * 12 months).

Multiplying the 40M people who wear contact lenses with 24 pairs a year gives 960M pairs of contact lenses worn by people in a year.

My contact lenses cost roughly $5 a pair. Therefore, the market size of contact lenses is $4.8B (960M pairs * $5 per pair). $4.8B is the market size for contact lenses in the US.”

Again, notice how I am **walking the interviewer through every step of the calculation**. Even though it **sounds painful**, doing so will greatly reduce the chance that you make a mathematical mistake since you are doing the math out loud. It will also ensure that the interviewer is following along.

Secondly, notice that I am providing some **justifications for my numbers**. I am not making them up out of thin air, but trying to explain where and how I got those numbers.

The interview does not care if you got the market size wrong. The **interviewer is evaluating** you on: (1) the structured approach that you developed in this market sizing exercise and (2) whether or not you did the math easily without making any major mistakes


#### Breakeven Analysis

A **breakeven analysis calculates what would have to be true in order for you to achieve exactly zero profits**. This type of question is much easier than the market sizing question because you simply **follow a standard mathematical equation that calculates the breakeven point**.

**3 equations you need to memorize:**

1. **Profit = Revenue – Costs**
2. **Revenue = Quantity * Price**
3. **Costs = (Quantity * Variable Costs) + Fixed Costs**

If we insert the last two equations into the first one, we get the expanded formula for profit:

**Profit = (Quantity * Price) – ((Quantity * Variable Costs) + Fixed Costs)**

A breakeven analysis looks at the scenario in which profit = 0. Doing this with the profit equation above:

**0 = (Quantity * Price) – ((Quantity * Variable Costs) + Fixed Costs)**

Now, if we rearrange this equation, we can simplify it a bit to derive the breakeven equation.

**Quantity * (Price – Variable Costs) = Fixed Costs**


Notice how both of the equations have four different variables (remember profit = 0 in breakeven).

Breakeven questions are pretty easy to solve tbh.

##### Minimizing mistakes while doing math

Example: We have sold eleven million cars at a price of seventeen thousand dollars. How much revenue is that?

$11M * $17K

($11 * $17) * (M * K)

($187) * (B)

$187B in revenue

Example: We have $143,000,000 in revenue and 13,000 customers. What is the average spend per customer?

$143M / 13K

($143 / 13) * (M / K)

($11) * (K)

$11K spend per customer

A strategy to use is to make a sense check, ex asking yourself the question if the number seems reasonable or it its too low/high or if you can benchmark or compare it to other numbers.

You can differentiate yourself from other candidates by talking through your sense check out loud. This shows the interviewer that you are not just calculating numbers like a robot, but conceptualizing the number to understand what it means and if it makes sense.


### IX. Answering Qualitative Business Questions


Qualitative business questions test your logic, reasoning, and general business intuition for basic business concepts. 

This is what the interviewer is looking for: 
- Basic knowledge of business terms and principles 
- Astute, sharp business intuition 
- Structured responses to qualitative business questions 
- Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident way

You will also quickly learn and develop an astute, sharp business intuition from doing practice case interviews.


#### Fundamentals of business knowledge

##### Market Share

**Market Share = Revenue earned in a market (in dollars) / Size of the market (in dollars)**

Say, for example, that a pet food manufacturer has revenues of $10B. If the size of the pet food market is $50B, then that pet food manufacturer has a 20% market share. ($10B/$50B)

##### Profit margin

Profit margin measures how much a company actually takes in from selling a product once costs have been accounted for. It is calculated by taking the profit and dividing it by the price of the product or revenue.

**Profit Margin = Profit (in dollars) / Revenue (in dollars)**

If I am selling pizzas for $10, but it costs me roughly $6 to make a pizza, then my profit margin is 40% ($4 profit/$10 price).

##### Return on investment (ROI)

ROI is a metric used to determine how attractive a particular investment is. Mathematically, it is calculated by taking the profit from the investment and dividing it by the total investment cost for a given time period. There are 1- year ROI calculations, 3-year ROI calculations, 10-year ROI calculations, and so on. When calculating ROI make sure to clarify what the time horizon is for the calculation

**ROI = Profit from Investment (in dollars) / Investment Cost (in dollars)**

Let’s say, **for example**, that I can invest $50K in a friend’s pet shop  and expect a profit of $65K over the next two years. The alternative option is to invest $12K in a coworker’s novel and earn $24K profit in the next two years. In these two examples, we are interested in the 2-year ROI.

The pet shop has an ROI of 1.3x ($65K/$50k) while the novel has an ROI of 2x ($24K/$12K)

##### Barriers to entry
Barriers to entry are simply the obstacles that a company would need to overcome to enter a new market. **Examples of barriers to entry are:** capital, technical knowledge/expertise, brand name, distribution channels, economies of scale, technology, government regulation, and product differentiation.

##### Variable and fixed costs
Costs can be categorized into either variable costs or fixed costs. The difference between the two is that **variable costs increase directly with the number or quantity of product that is made while fixed costs do not**. You can also think about it this way: if you were to **produce one more unit of product, variable costs are the costs associated with producing that one extra unit**

##### Fragmented vs. concentrated market
A fragmented market is composed of many different companies and none having large market share. Example is 100 different players with 1% market share is a highly fragmented market.

A concentrated market has few players that collectively have a large market share. For example, a market where the top four players have 90% of the market share would be a highly concentrated market

The **competitiveness of the market generally determines how high the barriers to entry are**. For a **fragmented market, there are generally low barriers to entry**. The **rationale** behind this is that if there were high barriers to entry, there would not be so many players participating in the market. A **concentrated market has high barriers to** entry. The rationale behind that is that there are only a few large players in the market because they were the only ones capable of overcoming the high barriers to entry.

Generally, it is easier to enter a fragmented market since the barriers to entry are low. A concentrated market can only be entered if the high barriers to entry are met, making it much more difficult.

##### Supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and retailer

A **supplier** is typically referred to as the company that sells raw materials to another company, who then uses the raw materials to create a product to sell in the market. The company that uses the raw materials to create the final product is known as the **manufacturer**. A **distributor** is typically a company that transports the final product to places where the product can be sold. **Retailers** are companies that sell the product.



##### Pricing strategy

There are different ways to price a product or offering.

1. One strategy is to determine how much a customer is willing to pay for the product. Could be done through customer surveys or focus groups, but hard because not even customers know what they are willing to pay for a hypothetical product
2. A second way is to look at the price competitors are selling their products for and then price your product in the competitors range. This only works if your competitors offer the same or similar product to what you are trying to sell
3. A third way is to look at the cost to product the product and assign a profit margin to the product and set the price accordingly. This however leaves out the customers willingness to buy the product at a certain price point.

##### Buyer power (or purchasing power)

Buyer power is a qualitative measure of **how much power a company has in setting the price of raw materials or services that it purchases from a supplier.**

For example, let’s say that there are two wooden furniture manufacturers that each have 50% market share and purchase wood, the raw material, from suppliers. Let’s say that there are hundreds of different suppliers of wood. In this scenario, the wooden furniture manufacturers have very strong or high buying power. There are only two players that purchase wood, but hundreds of different players that sell wood. Because of this discrepancy, the wood sellers are more likely to sell wood at a discounted price because there are only two players who they can sell to, and they are competing with the other hundreds of sellers. For the wooden furniture manufacturers, it is very likely that they will be able to purchase wood at a preferred lower price point.

In the reverse scenario, let’s say that there are hundreds of cherry pie producers that each have <1% market share. Let’s assume that there are only two cherry suppliers in the market that sell raw cherries. In this scenario, the cherry pie producers have very low buying power. Since there are only two suppliers of cherries, but hundreds of cherry pie producers that need to purchase these cherries, suppliers do not need to offer discounts or reduced prices in order to be able to sell their raw materials. It is unlikely that the cherry pie producers will be able to purchase cherries at a price point that they are happy with since they have low buying power.

In summary, **buyer power is high or strong if buyers are more concentrated than sellers**. However, buyer power can also be strong if there are many substitutes for the raw material that they are buying, and if the costs of switching to a substitute raw material is low.

For example, let’s say that a beef hot dog player purchases beef to make hot dogs. If suddenly pork prices drop to a historic low, and it is relatively easy for the hot dog player to switch to producing pork hot dogs, then that player may have strong buyer power even if the beef hot dog producer market is not heavily concentrated. The beef hot dog player can ask for a lower price point from suppliers, and threaten to switch to pork if prices are not met.

##### Reasons for making a merger/acquisition

The most **common reason** tends to be that a **company is lacking a particular product or offering in their portfolio**. Rather than invest the resources organically to develop that product or offering, the company instead decides to acquire another company that has that product or offering. This is done because it might be easier and/or cheaper to acquire that missing product into the portfolio rather than developing it themselves from scratch.

A second **common reason** is for **synergies**. A synergy occurs when the **interaction of two parts** (in this example, two companies) produces a **combined positive effect or outcome that is greater than the sum of the two individual parts.**

For example, if Company A, worth $7B, and Company B, worth $3B, merge and have revenue synergies, then the combined value of Company A and Company B could be $11B. This is $1B more than the sum of the two parts had they been separate companies.

**Synergies** can be broken down into **revenue synergies** and **cost synergies**. 

1. Examples of revenue synergies include: 
	1. having access to a new customer base or market, 
	2. being able to cross-sell products to existing customers, 
	3. and sharing overlapping infrastructure or distribution channels. 
2. Examples of cost synergies include:
	1. headcount reduction from eliminating redundancies, 
	2. reduced overhead or fixed costs from consolidating functions (e.g. HR, marketing), 
	3. and increased buying power.


**The third reason** why a company would acquire another company is because they see a smaller, high-growth **competitor as a threat**. By acquiring the company, this eliminates such a threat. Doing acquisitions is a way to grow the company and increase market share without doing much work

The **fourth reason** is that a company may purchase another company just to diversify its portfolio.

For example, a beer company might purchase a soda company. Had the beer company not purchased the soda company and a lot of people stopped drinking beer, then the company would see a huge drop in revenue. However, if the company had acquired a soda company, the drop in revenue would not be as large because they also sell soda, and soda sales may not have necessarily dropped if beer consumption drops.


##### Private Equity

The short, simplified definition of private equity is that private equity is comprised of firms that generally have a lot of money, that invest and/or purchase other companies for the sake of getting a return on investment (ROI) in one way or another

One way that they can get an ROI is by purchasing companies that are not performing well that may or may not be profitable. They then turn these companies around so that they are performing well and profitable. Private equity firms would then sell off these companies at a higher price than what these companies were originally purchased for. You can think of this strategy as “flipping companies”, much like a stock trader would flip stocks.

For mergers and acquisitions, companies that are not doing well and are not profitable are generally not attractive targets to acquire. However, for private equity firms, this is not the case because they sometimes target these underperforming companies, turn them around, and then sell for profit.

A second way that private equity firms can get an ROI is by purchasing a company that would create synergies with the rest of their portfolio. Remember, private equity firms can own many different companies at the same time in their portfolio. The synergies from an investment or purchase could enhance or increase their overall portfolio ROI in the long-run.

If you get a case involving private equity, make sure to ask for what strategy the private equity firm is looking to use to get an ROI. This will dictate what qualities you need to look for in the companies that may get bought out by the private equity firm

##### Price sensitivity

Price sensitivity measures the change in quantity of a product that a customer will purchase if the price changes. If a customer is highly price sensitive, even a small increase in price may cause them to stop buying the product altogether. If a customer is not price sensitive at all, a small increase in price will not cause them to purchase any less product.

Example is that if you are price sensitive to clothes and a brand increases their prices, you might not buy from them more because there are many other stores and you are not in immediate need of new clothes, so you are more likely to purchase less from that brand. But if you are diabetic, you might not be sensitive to insulin shots prices because there is **no substitute** for insulin shots and you buy because if you dont you die. Therefore, if the price of insulin shots increases, customers will continue buying regardless.

In summary, just remember that **increasing the price of a product may not necessarily increase revenues due to price sensitivity**. It is important to figure out if the incremental revenue that you get from increasing the price is greater than the loss of revenue from selling less product. The same logic applies for when you are decreasing the price of a product.

##### Ways to increase revenue

Revenue can be increased **organically** and **inorganically**. 
**Organic revenue** **growth** is revenue growth that a company achieves through its own efforts, internal to the company. **Inorganic growth** is growth through a merger or acquisition, done externally. Let’s look into organic growth first. First, revenue can be increased by increasing revenue from existing products. This can be done by either increasing the quantity sold of the product or by changing the price (remember which direction to change the price depends on price sensitivity of the customers Secondly, revenue can be increased by selling entirely new products that you did not previously offer. 

For **inorganic growth**, merging or acquiring a company increases revenue because you naturally will take in the revenue of the acquired company.

##### Ways to decrease costs

We can think of reducing costs by either **reducing variable costs** or **reducing fixed costs.**

**Fixed costs** are generally more difficult to reduce because fixed costs are determined in the longer-run and have contracts or “locked-in” costs that last for many years. For example, once equipment purchases are made, they generally can’t have their costs reduced since they are already purchased and are being used for many years to come. However, fixed costs could be potentially reduced if contracts are renegotiated, but the likelihood of this is lower than the chance of reducing variable costs.

For example, the costs of rent for a warehouse (a fixed cost) could be decreased if renegotiated with the landlord.

**Variable costs** tend to be easier to reduce. One way is that the company can switch to a supplier that sells the same raw material at a cheaper price. If the same raw material cannot be bought at a cheaper price, the company can look for substitutes for that raw material, but this is not always possible. Another way is that the company can try to use less of each raw material in the production process. However, note that any of these changes could affect the quality of the product. As with fixed costs, another way to reduce costs would be to renegotiate prices of raw materials with the current supplier.

##### Economies of scale

Economies of scale is the advantage that a company gets in terms of buying power as it produces and sells more and more product. As companies grow, they generally sell more and more product such that they have more buying power from suppliers. The increased buying power allows the company to purchase raw materials and other variable costs at much lower prices than competitors. This allows the company to price their product at a lower price point. The lower price, in turn, allows them to sell even more product, which results in even more increased buying power. This cycle can repeat as the company continues to grow

The cycle described above is referred to as the process of a company achieving economies of scale. The company’s costs get lower and lower while they sell more and more product. This cycle eventually does stop when suppliers are no longer able to reduce the costs of raw materials that they can sell, because they too need to make a profit off of the sale of raw materials. At this point, the company has achieved the maximum benefit of economies of scale.

Companies that have achieved economies of scale are buying raw materials at the lowest price point possible, allowing them to sell a large quantity of product and achieve high market share.

#### How to answer qualitative business questions

The following are some examples of qualitative business questions that you may get asked.

- What are some barriers to entry in the cable TV market?
- What are some variable and fixed costs that you can think of for starting a food truck?
- What are some reasons for why a pharmaceutical company would buy another pharmaceutical company?
- What are some ways to increase video game revenue?
- How can we decrease manufacturing costs of wooden furniture?
- How much market share do you think we can capture in this new market?
- Looking at our portfolio of four products. Which ones should we invest heavily in? Which ones should we divest?
- What are some ways we can price this new product?
- Do you think this is a competitive market?


So how do you differentiate yourself from the thousands of other candidates out there? There are several ways that you can do this.

Usually a candidate simply lists the top three random ideas that came to their head. For this reason, the response may appear to ramble on or repeat a few points.

An ordinary candidate might say something like this: 
“There are many benefits to hosting the Super Bowl. First of  all, you can bring money into the city from selling tickets to the event. Secondly, you can bring national attention and recognition to the city, since the entire US will likely be watching it on television or keeping up with it. Third, an increase in guests will probably lead to increased spending in the city economy overall.”

**Compare this answer to the following one from a candidate who spent an extra five to ten seconds structuring their response:**

“There are both short-term and long-term benefits that can be realized from hosting the Super Bowl. Starting with the short term benefits, the big thing that comes to mind is revenue. Hosting the Super Bowl can bring revenue into the city, from ticket sales to hotel and housing spend, food and drink consumption, and general tourist purchases. For the long-term benefits, one such benefit would be city branding/reputation. With the entire US keeping up with the Super Bowl, this is a long-term opportunity for the city to create a positive image of itself to encourage future tourism."

Having a simple structure to your qualitative answers makes a big difference in differentiating yourself from the other candidates.

##### Here is a list of quick mini-frameworks that you can leverage to structure your answer:

- Internal/external 
- Short-term/long-term 
- Economic/non-economic
- Quantitative/qualitative

By using these pairings of words, your answers will be much more organized than the majority of the rest of the candidates.

The **second way to differentiate yourself** is from creative brainstorming. You can show creativity in two different ways.

The first way is to simply list a large quantity of ideas. Instead of coming up with 2 barriers to entry in a market, you can come up with 5+.

The second way to demonstrate creativity is to come up with an idea that none of the other candidates had thought of. Some people can naturally come up with more creative and unique ideas than others. However, it is very difficult to improve on this skill in a short period of time.

With that said, I **recommend that you invest the majority of your time on structuring your responses and being able to come up with many ideas for each qualitative question**. This will differentiate yourself from the rest of the candidate




### X. Delivering a Conclusion

Delivering the conclusion is the last impression that you will leave with the interviewer. Therefore, it is important that you deliver a solid conclusion and recommendation.

A good conclusion and recommendation satisfies the following criteria: 
1. Starts with a confident, assertive recommendation 
2. Is structured 
3. Includes next steps

During this part of the case, the interviewer is looking for your: 
- Ability to synthesize all of the information discussed during the case and pull out the key takeaways 
- Ability to deliver a firm recommendation backed by facts, business acumen, and judgement
- Ability to communicate in a clear, concise, and confident way

For the ==first criteria==, **make sure that your conclusion starts with your recommendation**. The very **first sentence of your conclusion should state an assertive recommendation**.

Mistakes:
- One **common mistake** many candidates make is that they **begin their conclusion by summarizing the problem**, and then **describing the process and the steps that they have gone through** before **arriving at the recommendation**. For case interviews, you want to **start with the recommendation first. The answer should come first, not last.**
- The **second common** mistake is that when prompted for a recommendation, candidates will often **heavily hedge their recommendation**. However, interviewers might interpret this as you being unconfident and unassertive. Even if you feel that your recommendation might not be the correct one, **I recommend that you pick a side and present your recommendation in a firm and assertive manner**. If you feel strongly that your recommendation may not be correct, **you can hedge your recommendation in the “next steps” portion of the conclusion.**


For the second criteria, structure is highly important for the conclusion. I would recommend that you use a structure similar to the one below. It is simple, clean, and effective.

For the ==second criteria==, **structure is highly important for the conclusion**. I would recommend that you use a structure similar to the one below. It is simple, clean, and effective.

A structured conclusion should look something like this:


- I recommend that we (insert recommendation) for the following three reasons:
	1) … 
	2) …
	3) …
- For these reasons, I recommend that we (insert recommendation)
- For next steps, I would like to look into the following two things: 
	1) … 
	2) …


For the **third criteria**, **including “next steps” in your conclusion is important because it shows that you are thinking ahead of areas that you would like to further look into if you had more time.** Most candidates do not discuss next steps, so including this part can help you **differentiate yourself** from the other candidates.

You shouldn’t necessarily be doing any novel thinking to come up with next steps. During the case interview, there should have **naturally been a couple of points where you wished you had more information** or **where you wanted to do another piece of analysis**. You can use these points as your next steps. Therefore, **next steps  should not always be new ideas that the interviewer is hearing for the first time.**


For example, leveraging the structure above, a strong recommendation and conclusion would sound something like this:

“I recommend that we do not enter the peanut butter market for the following three reasons. 

One, we looked at the competitive landscape and learned that the top four players have 90% of the market share. This suggests that the market is highly concentrated with high barriers to entry.

Two, we looked into possible synergies with our existing strawberry jam product. Peanut butter and strawberry jam have little to no synergies. We would have to buy new equipment and develop a proprietary peanut butter recipe to enter the peanut butter market. 

Three, we looked at the financial considerations and determined it would take ten years for us to break even in this market. Since management is looking for additional profit in the next two to three years, entering the market does not make sense financially. 

For these reasons, I recommend that we do not enter the peanut butter market. 

For next steps, I would like to look into the following two things to further confirm my recommendation. One, I’d like to look into the overlap between strawberry jam customers and peanut butter customers. If there is no overlap, we probably can’t cross-sell strawberry jam with peanut butter and leverage our existing customer relationships. Two, since it doesn’t seem like we want to enter the market organically, it may be worth looking into partnerships or strategic alliances to see if these are attractive enough for us to consider entering the market inorganically.”

Transitioning from solving the case to presenting a recommendation and conclusion can be fairly challenging. During the case, you most likely will have covered quite a bit of ground on a variety of topics. The challenging part of the conclusion is pulling together all of the key findings that you have discovered and determining what these key findings mean for the answer.

**You should have been taking brief notes on key takeaways throughout the case on your note sheet**. Having done this, **you simply need to quickly scan through your notes to review what the key takeaways are, and think about what that means for the answer.**


It is acceptable for candidates to ask their interviewer for 30 seconds to read through their notes and organize their thoughts before delivering a structured conclusion. However, if your interviewer gives you time to think through the conclusion, they will expect more structure from you than if you immediately started delivering your recommendation and conclusion when prompted for a summary. **Its best to just give a full conclusion and be ready to give it as well by having the notes at hand**

### XI. Everything You Need to Memorize

There are actually not that many things you need to memorize for case interviews. More of it comes down to understanding and mastering concepts. This comes with practice. Below are all of the things that we’ve covered that should be memorized.

### XII Practicing cases

It may be helpful to video record yourself during practice case interviews. This way you can analyze your body gestures and speaking patterns. Oftentimes, you’ll be surprised with your body language or what you actually say during a practice case. I wouldn’t do this with every practice case, but I’d try to do this every time you feel that you have taken a significant step forward.


Although I strongly encourage you to practice case interviews with a partner, the practice cases in this book are written so that you can do them alone or with a partner. However, after these first few cases, you should definitely be doing case interviews live with a case interview partner.
