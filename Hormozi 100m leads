#### Lead magnet:
A complete free or low cost solution for a narrow problem, that once solved reveals a newer problem that will be solved by our main offer

Do not give away free resources without anything. The free resource has to lead to your main offer.

##### 3 types of lead magnets:
1. Those that reveal problems the client does not know they had. ex if you do SEO selling you can show clients speed of their website
2. Full access to a requiring service, ex trial to software or first cream in a series of creams
3. Last lead magnet if you have multiple steps in your offer.

##### Countless ways to come up with lead magnets:
1. Provide access to a software - a simple spreadsheet/software that show how the customers statistics compare to the industry
2. Offer valuable info or courses or educational materials to teach something valuable
3. Offer free or low cost service ex website review
4. Give a complementary product, ex extra pill, makes people want to compensate you
	1. Lead magnet should have higher value than the main offers cost
5. Give away your secrets then sell the offer. 99% of the people will not buy from you but will create or destroy your reputation based on the lead magnet they get

##### How to draw leads to your lead magnet
Creating a lead campaign.

There are 4 types of people you can reach out to:
- 1 to 1 private - people who know you --> **Warm outreach**
	- customers, friends, osv...
	- 1-1 is basically mass emailing people
- 1 to 1 private - people who don't know you --> **cold outreach**
	- Someone elses audience. can be reached by buying lists, osv...
- 1 to Many Public - people who know you --> **Free content**
	- 1 to many is scial meada and stuff
- 1 to Many Public - People who dont know you --> **Paid ads**


**Warm outreach**
- People you in one way or another know
- Create a list of contacts
- Send out 100 personalized messages to 100 people every day for 100 days
- When get a response use ACA framework:
	- Acknowledge
		- ex you asked about a baby and they say yes then return the answer with omg 2 kids? And you work full time...
	- Complement
		- You are the best dad ever that can do that
	- Ask
		- Ask another question and steering towards your offer. Ex do you have someone cleaning your house
- Make an offer but in an indirect way. Start by offering the service for free to first 5 people, and explain the offer based on the value equation. Ex. This will make yuo reach (dream outcome) in (time delay)
- If you ask someone to use your product for free and then just leave a review and they do not agree, it means that what you are offering does not have enough value to justfify their time.
- The 5 first customers are free to help you learn, then you offer the next 5 80% discournt, then 60%, then 40%, ... osv... This is so that you learn and gather initiall reviews

**Free content**
Share to your network.
Often times when you contact a customer, they will look at you and your background and then decide if they want to buy. Therefore, it is important that there is some free content on your site or social media.

Pattern to keep content engageing

1. Hook Attention
	1. Catchy headline or picture
2. Retention
	1. Valuable nad original content
3. Reward
	1. Satisfy the reason they started consuming content. SO if they in the beginning got attracted by being curious of something, make sure they get the answer

Need to master give and ask ratio:
- many build a audience then give out too many offers, and in turn they burn out the list
- What you need to do is offer much content and occasionally offer paid stuff
- Or you give out free content and then after a while it should be paid
- The longer you give out free content the better

Give : Ask ratio:
- Keep on giving until the customers ask you to sell them something


**Cold outreach**

Reach out 1 on 1 to people that dont know you - knocking on doors, cold calls, cold emails...

This is not easy, but if it works it yields very predictable and good results.

With cold contacts you can very precisely find your targets

Best advice is to find someone who has already done it to help you.

How to do:
- Find contact list (buy)
- Find a way to start convo
- Find a way to grab their attention in the first 30 seconds
	- Goal is to turn them from cold leads to engaged leads
	- Send them to lead magnet or offer depending on how it goes
- Numbers game
	- Contact leads cyclicly in many different ways many times


**Paid ads**
Reaching your target is guaranteed, but the question is how well you do it

First thing is to find out who to target with your campaigns but not too specific.

Find a platform that your customers might use a lot


Ads framework:
- call out
	- whatever you do to attract the attention of audience, could be phrases like moms of clark county or gym owners, or sounds, etc. Anything that grabs prospects attention
- Value
	- Value is given to the customer when what you offer costs little in contrast to what it provides
	- DO THIS BASED ON THE VALUE EQUATION
- Call to Action
	- Tell the customer what to do, ex: Click here now or fill out the form
	- Be clear to direct them to your lead magnet
	- Usually goes to a landing page and then these people will be seen as warm leads

There will be expenses in the beginning, and you need to ride out the different ads till you find the one that works.


##### Metrics to know

2 fundamental data points


Lifetime gross profit:
- total lifetime pendage by customer - cost to deliver
- ex 150 dollars for lifetime of customer, and you spend 50 total, then its 100 dollars

Customer Acquisition cost:
- Promotional cost/ Acquired customers
- If spend 1000 dollars on promotion and acquire 10 customers, then its 100 dollars per customer you get

Now one parameter to measure how a campaign is working you measure:

**Lifetime Gross Profit / Customer Acquisition Cost.**

if >1 = campaign in profit but not so good
if > 3 = Good campaign
if < 3 = need to improve the campaign.

If the ratio is above 3 then the promotion is good but have sales problem.
If below 3 you have a promotion problem.

You can reach over 3 if you have a good campaign and offer
If bellow 3 then you need to improve the campaign. Several ways to do it:
- review parts of the campign and target
- Upsell high margin products to customers in first 30 days to increase lifetime gross profit.
- Principles of creating ads/promos are easy, just watch a video on how to do it


#### What to do:
Find 2 of the 4 promo ways and stick to them

Find what works and ask yourself what keeps me from investing more in this promotion. Find the bottleneck then continue. You can do this to a specific point then the promotion does not work more. For this you need to analyse customer acquistion flow.
- ex: 3 step flow
- Click on ad
- Land on landing page
- Leave contacts

You need to see which of these 3 step are the bottleneck and then improve it.

You can create a new campaign then, either on a new or old platform.


#### Lead getters
Core four not only give you leads, but also Lead Getters;

Word of mouth of service and you is very important.

Reasons you do not get referals from your customers:

- Your product is not good enough
- You dont ask for referals
	- You need to incorporate so that the customers actually can easily put referals in various stages of the promotion
	- Make it easy by providing them with tools or materials to introduce what you do and what advantages their referals and they themselves get
	- Look at the customer acquistion cost and give it to the referals instead 
##### Affiliates
A type of lead getter. Its important that they promote your stuff. Ex: Course plattform for you courses
There are various ways to involve the affiliates.
Push the affiliates to sell your product
