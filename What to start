#### What to start?

##### 3 P's framework
1. Pain:
	1. Something you went through and you had to overcome, ex: wife with 9 kids and has system for feeding them
2. Profession
	1. What you do as work and what you learn there
	2. Can do as consultant
	3. Can do as products
	4. etc...
3. Passion
	1. What you are interested in
	2. What you read about, what podcasts you follow, osv...

Often times you will not get the best idea on the first try, but you do the best worst idea. Then you will remake it so many times.

#### Who

Who are you gonna do this "What" for
1. People like you
2. People you helped before
3. People you think are underserved (ex growing markets osv...)

Pick one of these three things (mostly nr 1 people choose)

Narrow down the Avatar (pick atleast 3):
- Age
- Gender
- Profession
- Problem
- Interests

Ex: If you could fill a room with people you would be excited to help, who would it be?

You will want to narrow down your offer as well.
If you sell time managment system it could be 19 dollar, if its for sales its 99 dollar, if its for outbound sales its 1999 dollars then if its even more nische you can higher the price even more. Also the more nische you are the less competitors there are.



#### How - good stuff
All the good stuff you will help people acheive. How much easier someones life will be by using your thing.

- Easier 
- Guaranteed
- Faster
- Experience the dream

The best offer is incredibly easy, guaranteed to happen immediately and just as they want

#### How - bad stuff
Either give them good stuff or take away the bad stuff

Basically how to help people remove the bad things or how you would help them do better.

The better you explain the pains the more they will trust you, ex dont say "this will help you lose weight", but instead "this will help you not get pain in your thighs on summer days". This makes it so that they see that you know their pains and they will be like omg how does this person know this about me and trust you more

Instead of guarantee, we talk about risks the custommer will avoid

Instead of how fast it is, we explain how they will skip the slow stuff

Instead of easy we will say the pain and sacrifice and suffer they go through to see the benefits
- Basically explain what are the good stuff they give up right now that they wont have to with your system
- What are all the bad things they normally have to do with other products that they do not need to do with your system
	- Ex: if i want to lose weight, with me you do not need to wake up early and dont eat foods you like. Normally you would give up taco tuesdays and eating out with your friends, but still get the results you want.

If you want to know these stuff do the
##### 3 letter method:
Ask people you want to sell
- call them and do an interview
- What are problems you are struggling with right now
- How long have you struggled with them
- What makes it painful specifically
- Can you explain the experience when its not right
- How would the experience look if it was right
- What are some things you need to stop doing that you like doing that you do not want to stop doing
- What are things you have to start doing that you hate doing and that you have done in the past

The culmination of these questions will make


#### Combine
I help ==who== get ==how part 1 (the good stuff)== without ==how part 2 (bad stuff)== through ==Bonus U.M==

The last part (U.M) is more advanced, but the beginning is the best part to do.


#### Unique Mechanism

You want some special sauce that makes people choose you

Basically a list or number of steps someone has to follow.
- Basically weightwatchers have point system people follow
- 


Basically Duolingo gameified language, weight watchers gamified food, vad mer finns att gamifiera?
