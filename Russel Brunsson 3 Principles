Each movement has 3 characteristics it follows


#### 1. Becoming the expert

Each great movement has a great leader leading it

You need to guide your ideal customers to their destination
- everyone does it in their own style

Customers may be aware of you because of a product you sell, but stay with you because of the product you sell.

There are 5 phases to becoming an expert

##### Step 1 - find your passion
Immerse yourself in the subject
Fascination + masery = passion

##### Step 2 - the reporter
Counting only on wht you know about the topic is not enough, you need to learn from different perspectives

ex different books, attend events, networking, podcasts, osv...

##### step 3 - your framework

Once you have your own knowledge and also know from other people, you summarize them in a framework making it also easy for people to follow it. Basically a roadmap.

Whether you sell a physical product or software, you need a framework. People buy stuff to achieve a certain result. and as you nieche in it, you need to create a framework.

###### How to create the framework
First you create the hypothesis, then test it on yourself/your business

When you see success personally, you need to provide it to others to test it
- When you get predictable results you can change it

(DENNA DEL KOMMER JAG INTE GÖRA!)
next step is getting known and finding your voice
- basically daily posting for a year
- you could document what you do and share it instead of trying to find new content all the time
- This makes it easier to "find your voice" 
- Make sure content is engaging and not trivial
- Mellanting mellan crazy or trivial. Should not be part of crazyland and not part of mainstream
- You will have both people who dislike and like your content, if you appeal to everyone you will not find a core audience.

###### People will do anything for those who:
- encourage their **dreams**, (promote succes of investing)
- justify their **failures**, (not their fault if not profits from investing )
- allay their **fears**, (explain how to protect capital first)
- confirm their **suspicions**, (confirm suspisions that bank people care not about their money)
- and help them throw rocks at their **enemies** (criticize banks)

This type of communication will help and attact a certian typ of audience.

Be authentic and help those that follow you and dont make it about money, för då ser man igenom det.

Instead make it so that you truly try to help the ones who follow you, and money will come as a consequence.

###### How to teach your framework

1. Everything revolves around the framework, you can explain it either in 2 minutes or 2 days
	1. You must explain it in a way people understand its values
	2. Before revealing it, explain how you learnt about it and made it and the emphasizing effort it took to create it. Do not rush into technical part.
	3. Talk about strategy first and tactics later. (Strategy is the overall plan and set of objectives you have with the framework, tactics is the step by step)
	4. Final step is to show how others have used your framework. People might see it as if you are an expert and the framework only works for you. Show that all can do it.

###### What market should you position yourself in

3 main markets
1. Wealth
2. Health
3. Relationships

These have submarkets ex:
- wealth
	- investments
	- sales
	- finance
	- etx
- relationships
	- wedding services
	- dating advice
	- etc
- health
	- diet 
	- nutrition
	- workout trainings
	- etc

Markets and submarkets have many competitors, so you instead have to find your **nische** in those.

A mistake is to look at current nisches and trying to position themselves there. You have to yourself instead create your own nische, which is hard

###### How to find your own nische

The market is not made up of people, its a location

The right question is not WHO is your target market

The right question is **WHO is your ideal customer** and **WHERE is your ideal market**.
- where does your ideal customer go?

In the end you will create your market nische.

###### How do you acquire customers

Go into sub market of choice and target the frustrated customers that exists.

Not worth convincing die hard fans of competitors.
The satisfied customers might not be happy with their current company, but the inconvenience of changing is not worth it. 

The **frustrated customer** uses competitor products. They do not know the other products but would want to change to something better
- The offer could **compete** with what is given in that market or **complement** it
- Compete ex: Dove entered highly competitive soap market but marketed themselves as not soap but dove, and that they are moisturizers.
- Complement: Surplus of oranges being farmed, so company started selling orange juice machines and marketed it as healthy orange juice. This led to machines being sold and more oranges as well.

You must understand the market and the frustrated customers that come with it



#### Step 2 - The opportunity

For every succesfull mass movement, the leader has presented a new opportunity isntead of an improvement offer.

Not trying to fix something that is broken.
We want to create a new category and become its leader.

Offering an improvement is difficult nad doesnt work well for many reasons:
- Customers will associate your product with previous ones  that didnt work
	- this means you are selling a comodity and nothing differentiated
- Main reason is status
	- improvement does not change the status (new gas car)
	- but if you present the new opportunity well it does change status (ex electric car instead of gas)

##### How do you create a new opportunity

- Identify which of the 3 main marktes the customer resides in
- identify the vehicle they are using and the frustration they have
- decide if your new opportunity is a nische change or if you will go up a level and change their sub market




#### step 3 The vision


Decide what future you want, codify it and continue communicating it 

Create identify shift in customer you acquire.

You do not want them to buy your product, you want them to become your product.

(ex Huel t shirts?)

People ususally start with the leader then stay for the community

Lastly, story telling is the most important thing.
