Sales funnels - How to guide customers to more premium products

Difference between funnel and standard website

Website is a brochure and lots of info, you do not guide them, the more confused they are the less they buy

Funnel has pages with single purposes. Either do what the website wants you to do or leave. Here you have much more control over customers journey

A funnel is wide at the beginning and narrow at the end, because many will enter funnel and few will buy, and even fewer will buy a lot. Those are your ideal customers.

Brunson has checked and researched different pages for different customers.

#### Value ladder:
- At the bottom is free or low cost products/services
- The higher up the more premium is the product
- The sales will change on different ladders


**Order bumb:**
Adding something to your prouct. Ex Amazon book 13 dollars, pay 4 more dollars to get uadio book. Or buy coffe for 5 dollars and get chocolate for 1 dollar.

**After order is done**:
- Dont immedialely say ok order is done
- Upsell stuff
- Customers will buy something and when it is bought they will feel like they already have it, so you must upsell something for future problems or something complementary
- If you sell an e book on six packs, dont upsell another six pack book. Instead sell maybe a nutrional guide upsell with the book.
- If they accept the upsell, you can continue the upsell on the next page. Also, this should be like special deals not only same price

#### When customer has decided to make an offer

##### 7 stages of funnel

###### 1. Determine the temperature

There are 3 types of traffic:
- Hot
	- Know what product they want and who you are
- Warm 
	- Know what they desire but not the product, they might know about the competition but not you
	- Here it is best to start by communicating about their desire before introducing them to the product
- Cold
	- Neither aware of product or desire, but aware of the problem they have and they dont know you
	- Here you need to start by speaking about the problem
###### 2. Pre-frame bridge

Extremely important stage

Its the state you put someone when they enter your funnel

When the author had a sales presentation where he got a really good introduction, he had much better results.

In practice this means:
The colder the traffic, the longer the preframe needs to be.

If you have cold traffic, its good to have a longer presentation and also maybe have a preliminary page.


###### 3. Qualify subscribers

When you bring someone to a landing page, the goal is to get the customers e mail

###### 4 Qualify buyers

Immediately after a user leaves their email, you want to see who the buyers are.

Take them directly to a sales page after this. Offer something inexpensive to lower the price barrier and see who the buyers are

###### 5 Identify hyper active buyers

After the first sale offer, propose the order bump and 2 upsales. Do it immeditalely. Because if someone is actively searching for seomting, we have a short windows in where they will buy something.

We will have 3 different lists.
- Hyperactive buyers
- Buyers
- Subscribers

###### 6 Age and ascend the relationships

Once we have people on the list, you need to engage with them. 

You need an "attractive" character, basically someone with an appealing personality. The idea should be that the product is attractive. Ex. A personal trainer wants to work with weight loss, the trainer has a story as he went up in weight to understand the clients problems.

The relationship between you and your customer makes them more attracted to your company and pushes them up the value ladder.
