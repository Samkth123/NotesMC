### What is an offer?

You cant make a great offer if you sell the same thing as everyone else does
- if products are the same or similar, then price becomes the decision point (you are seen as a comodity)
- We do not want to be able to be compared to other products, we want to be differentiated.
- Differentiated products are pruchades driven by value

### Grand Slam Offer
- A offer that cant be compared to other product in the market
- It has:
	- Attractive promotion
	- Umaatched value propositio
	- premium price
	- unbeatable guarantee
	- Pricing model where you get paid to acquire new customers

Idea is to offer something so differnet so we dont even need to expliain why we are different

Framework:
Market --> Offer --> Persuasion

If **market** is bad its not worth getting into even, ex: selling to newspapper shops but their market is declining so they have no money

If offer is even normal, then you have to have a good sales person in persuasion part.

But if the offer is so good you dont even need a sales person.

Offer is better if it solves:

- A significant Problem (target audience must genuaily need what you are offering, not just want it)
- Target audience needs to have money 
- Easily identifiable target (is it easy to identify the targets? Will be easier)
- Market should be growing (Either a big market or one that is growing)
- Nische down the offer and dont be too broad.


The only reason someone buys is to make a deal, they must feel like they get more value for the price they pay. Best to sell at a high price by substantially highering value.

Value equation:

Dream outcome x Perceived likelihood of achievement
/
Time delay x Effort and sacrifice =
Value

Dream outcome x Perceived likelihood of achievement high
Time delay x Effort and sacrifice low
#### Step 1 find dream outcome
Nobody want a gym membership, thye want muscles

nobody wants airline tickets, thye want the holiday

You need to sell the result and experience, not the tool itself

#### Step 2 list all problems

list porblems and lmited thoughts to the dream outocme

what happens immediately before nad adter someone uses your products.

Each problem should be analyzed based on the grand slam offer value equation. Example customer thinks "ohh this ownt happen because it might take *too long* or its *too hard*"

#### Step 3 turn problems into solutions

ex:
problems soluton
healthty food is expensive --> how to make healthy ood shopping sutainable
healthy food is disgusting --> how to make helathy food tasty

#### Step 4 create vehcile for solution
Delivity can be 1 to 1 , small groups or one to many

When you do everything yourself then the solution is easy to sell but hard to fullfill, but if its easy to deliver because it might be done already then its harder to sell. Normally its best to find something that is easy to sell but hard to deliver

#### Step 5 Trim and stack
Here we should have a list of solutions for customer problems
Now we refine list by removing low value solutions by looking at value equation
Stack together solutiosn found for each problem we have found 

#### Step 6 supercharge offer
1. Urgency
2. Scarcity
3. Guarantees
4. Bonuses
5. Naming

We want to artificially increase demand for our products
Perfect is if we have high demand but low / or perception of low supply


##### How to create scarcity
- Limited availability of number of sports, products, osv...
- Limited availablity of bonuses
- limited availabilty of products
- Limited editions

People usually use scarcity fake and its obvious

A good way is to speak of how many customers you can serve at a time and use that for scarcity.

Scarcity is with the amount of product, Urgency has to do with time.

Having a defined deadline for a purchase creates urgency, ex: sign up now and you can join monday class, else you need to wait for next week


##### How to add bonuses

Concept is that a single offer is less valuable then offer broken down into its components and stacked as bonuses.

EX: its more valuable to buy 1 knife + 4 extra free for 100 dollars then 5 knives for 20 dollars each. This is because we increase the price - value gap. So we increase the value but not discount the price.

When present the knife, thye have a pre concieved view of the value, and start to think if the knife is worth 100 dollars. But then when you present the bonuses, then they get a new idea of the value of the offer as it goes up.

With bonuses, these things are importnat to give them:


1. Always offer them
2. Give special name that refelcts benefits
3. Explain them in terms of the value equation improves
4. Each bonus should adress a specific problem

The value of bonus should overshadow value of the offer and have nothing to do with the cost

#### How to offer a guarantee

Guarantees is a way to reverse the risk from the customer to the company. Many people use this.

Unconditional guarantees is that they get money back regardless (no questions asked)

Conditional: get money back upon agreements

Implied guarentees: Only get money back if numbers arent met

Use creative guarantees


Use 2-4 of these
#### How to name a product
We need to tell people that the product is for them and what problem is solves.

Use this formula: MAGIC

Magnet - create magnetic reason for why run promotion ex 88% off for christmanst
Avatar - who is our customer ex moms in NY
Goal - articulate dream outcome ex pain free vip smile
Interval - Give them a timeframe of how long - lose 10kg in 10 days 
Container - Use a work theat summarize
